What case defines what an offer is?,"
Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms. Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated. It is important to emphasise the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations.

 
It is this need for finality and definiteness which leads to the analytical need for the concept of invitation to treat. If a communication during negotiations is not the final expression of an alleged offeror’s willingness to be bound, it may be interpreted as an invitation to the other party to use it as a basis for formulating a proposal emanating from him or her that is definite enough to qualify as an offer. Thus the indefinite communication may be what generates an offer from the other side. An invitation to treat is thus to be distinguished from an offer on the basis of the proposal’s lack of an essential characteristic of an offer, namely, its finality which gives a capacity to the offeree to transform the offer into a contract by the mere communication of his or her assent to its terms. Thus Chitty on Contracts (28th Edition, 1999) Vol. 1 para. 2-007 at p. 93 states that:

 
“A communication by which a party is invited to make an offer is commonly called an invitation to treat. It is distinguishable from an offer primarily on the ground that it is not made with the intention that it is to become binding as soon as the person to whom it is addressed simply communicates his assent to its terms.”

 
A case relied on by the appellant, Gibson v Manchester City Council \[1979\] 1 All ER 972, is illustrative of a communication during “negotiations” which was not definite and final enough to be treated as an offer and therefore was rightly categorized as an invitation to treat. The case involved the tenant of a council house in Manchester, England, who wanted to buy the house from the council. In the middle of the process for the purchase of the property, following local government elections in May 1971, the local council changed its policy and decided not to proceed with the sale of any house in respect of which there had not yet been an exchange of contracts. The correspondence between the tenant and the council before this reversal of policy was as follows:

 
After the city council had adopted a policy of selling houses to its tenants, the City Treasurer, following a request made by the tenant in this case for details of the price of the house he was renting and the mortgage terms available, had written on 10th February 1971 to the tenant stating that the council “may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price 2,725 pounds less 20% - 2,180 pounds (freehold).” The letter then set out the mortgage terms likely to be made available and continued:

What are the principles of an injunction,"

From the litany of judicial decisions, it has also long been settled that in considering an application for injunction, a court ought to consider inter alia the following factors:

 
These principles were reiterated by this Court in the case of 18th July vs. Yehans International Ltd (2012) SCGLR 167, as follows:

 
“Even though \[the grant of injunction\] is discretionary, we are of the view that a … court in determining interlocutory application must first consider whether the case of an applicant was not frivolous and had demonstrated that he had legal or equitable right which a court should protect. Second the court is also enjoined to ensure that the status quo is maintained so as to avoid any irreparable damage to the applicant pending the hearing of the matter. The trial court ought to consider the balance of convenience and should refuse the application if its grant would cause serious hardships to the other party…”

 
Further, injunctions being primarily discretionary, the bonafides and malafides of the parties cannot be ignored in ascertaining whether to grant or refuse. \[See Owusu vrs Owusu-Ansah (Supra)\]

“Even though \[the grant of injunction\] is discretionary, we are of the view that a … court in determining interlocutory application must first consider whether the case of an applicant was not frivolous and had demonstrated that he had legal or equitable right which a court should protect.

What underpins res ipsa loquitor principle,"
It seems to me with respect though that the appearance of the mere phrase ""res ipsa loquitur"" is by itself, in fact, no foundation at all for the invocation of the doctrine. In my view the true foundation for the invocation of the doctrine is as clearly stated in the above passage. It is merely pleading and nothing else, only ""the facts from which it is intended that the presumption should be drawn."" Unfortunately probably the cautious \[p.329\] way in which it was expressed has inadvertently, I believe, led an academic writer to misconceive the true ratio decidendi and to suggest in the usual vein of academic writers but very wrongly in my view, that the decision of the full bench in applying the principle to the case is hard to justify. In a comment in (1970) 2 R.G.L. 73 at pp. 74-75 the writer noted:

 
""the case before the full bench of the Court of Appeal reduced itself simply to this: Did the plaintiff's pleadings give \`fair notice' to the defendants that res ipsa loquitur would be invoked?""

 
This is obviously a wrong appraisal of the case which the court had to contend with. I would have thought the case rather reduced itself to this: Did the plaintiff by his pleadings give fair notice to the defendants of the facts on which his negligence actual or presumptive is based? Res ipsa loquitur after all means as Lord Shaw put it in Ballard v. North British Railway Co. 1923,, S.C. (H.L.) 43 at p. 56, that the thing that had happened, the subject-matter of the plaintiff's complaint ""tells its own story."" In other words it thus means merely that the thing speaks for itself. What is it that speaks for itself? It is the facts and circumstances of the case taken together that figuratively speak of negligence. Consequently to introduce res ipsa loquitur in pleadings in the manner done by Bullen and Leake and Benas and Essenhigh and as was done in this case means no more than that at the trial the plaintiff intends to argue that the facts he will produce are prima facie evidence of negligence. In other words contrary to the provision of Order 19, r. 4 he is pleading argument not facts. Now in Woodroffe and Ameer Ali's Civil Procedure in British India (2nd ed.), the editors commenting on the corresponding provision in the India Civil Code noted at p. 701 that, ""Modern pleadings are merely concise statements of the facts. Inference of law should not be pleaded. Pleadings should not contain mere arguments."" (The emphasis is mine.)

 
In the light of all this it is obvious that the following advice proffered by the writer in (1970) 2 R.G.L. 73 at p. 75 can hardly be said to be useful:

 
""Where counsel is in the slightest doubt as to whether his pleadings disclose the invocation of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, he will be wise to plead it specifically. If by any reason of omission or default he is not able to do so at the very beginning of the case, he would be well advised to take advantage of the earliest opportunity to amend his pleadings so as to indicate clearly that res ipsa loquitur is in issue.""

As was stated regarding applications for injunctions which are repeated in the same court in Vanderpuye v Nartey 1977 GLR 428 ‘The courts must be left to determine at their discretion when a party is using their processes to pursue his frivolous or vexatious ends’. The critical requirement of a court in an application for injunction is to determine whether it is just and convenient to grant same.

 
Section 12 (b) of the Courts Act allows the full court to look again at an order earlier made by a single judge. Rule 28 of CI 19 allows a party to repeat an application which was earlier presented to the court below for consideration of the full court of appeal.

 
I am quite satisfied that the combined effects of Section 12 (b) of the Courts Act, rule 28 and 31 (e) of CI 19 give this court sufficient authority to admit the application as being in accordance with due process and consider it on its merit, given the fact that the original injunction order was made by a single judge of the court and lapsed after 10 days. I am also satisfied that the repetition of this application will not constitute an abuse of process because inter alia, this application addresses the reasons why the conditions attached to the first order could not be obeyed.

 
I will now consider the application on its merits. The critical issue for this court to consider is whether on the strength of the pleadings, affidavits, exhibits and submissions brought to this court, it is just and convenient to grant this application without the conditions that the single Judge earlier attached to the order, because it is these conditions that caused the first order to lapse.

 
The fact that the Applicant has thrown in ‘new material’ that its counsel says has been discovered since April 2016 does not detract from the fact that but for the conditions which the Applicant says were impracticable to fulfill, the earlier order would not have lapsed and this application could not be before us.

battery and assault principles,"
In the case of Cole vrs. Turner {1706} 6 Mod. 149, Holt C.J. stated that the least “touching of another in anger is a battery;” and this is still the law. In the law of battery there is no requirement to prove that the contact caused or threatened to cause any physical injury or harm. Thus in the case of Wilson vrs. Pringle \[1986\] 2 AER 440 at page 495 C.A., it was held that “an intention to injure is not essential to an action for trespass to the person which is the offence.”

 
Therefore the culpable touching may take several forms subject to the Rule that the contact must be direct.

 
The principle in awarding damages is to compensate the “Plaintiff” for the losses pecuniary and non-pecuniary which he had sustained as a result of the “Defendant’s” tort – more specifically the assessment process is said to aim at restitutio in integrum.

 
Here we cite the oft-quoted words of Lord Blackburn that “the Court should award that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured or who has suffered in the same position as he would have been in if he had not suffered the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.”

 
The loss for which the Plaintiff claims compensation must be caused by and must not be too remote a consequence of the defendants tort. Thus in the case before us, the Appellant must reasonably have foreseen that his conduct would aggravate the Respondent’s injury since he knew or should have known that the Respondent was not physically sound considering that he was using crutches.

the effect of failure to correct an error apparent on the face of the record of appeal,"
The court proceeded further to mention three such blunders, as error on the face of a crucial documentary evidence, and finally, “the finding is so based on erroneous proposition of law, that if that proposition be corrected the finding disappears”. It is important to point out that the establishment of a blunder or error per se is not enough. It must further be established that the said error has led to a miscarriage of justice.

 
We do not think the appellant herein discharged the burden on him or passed the test in the case cited so as to warrant the findings of fact and the principles of law applied by the lower courts, to be interfered with or set aside in this appeal. We rather affirm all of them and dismiss all grounds of appeal, original and or additional.

 
For all the foregoing, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed and the appeal dismissed.

legal opinion on force majeure,"
Per Osei-Hwere JSC. In the situation where the defendants were hit by a force majeure and were under a constraint to embark on a redundancy exercise, the plaintiffs could not have sued either for an injunction to restrain the defendants from dismissing them or specific performance. The remedy for their ""illegal"" dismissal truly lay in damages.

On 20 July 1971, the respondents, principal shareholders of Timber and Transport Co., Ltd. (T. & T. Co., Ltd.) entered into a written agreement with a Yugoslav company whereby the respondents agreed to transfer part of their shareholding in T & T Co., Ltd. to the Yugoslav firm, which for its part agreed to invest in and manage the company. It was further agreed that the name of T. & T. Co., Ltd. should be re-named: T. & T. Kumasi-Krusevac Co., Ltd. Clause 15 of the agreement provided that the agreement should remain irrevocable for ten years, and no member or director of the company as re-named could present \[p.371\] a petition or make an application to the court seeking the winding-up or the liquidation or in any way seek or attempt to bring the existence of the company to an end. Despite the existence of clause 15, the petitioners petitioned for the official winding-up of the company, and the appointment of the Registrar of Companies as the provisional liquidator. At the hearing of the petition, counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary objection as to whether having regard to clause 15 of the agreement, the petition was competent.

 
Held, upholding the preliminary objection: the law was clear that every contract was prima facie permanent and irrevocable, and it lay upon a person who said that it was revocable or determinable to show either some expression in the contract itself or something in the nature of the contract from which it was reasonable to be implied that it was not intended to be permanent and perpetual, but was to be in some way or other subject to determination. In the present case, the effect of clause 15 then was that a period of at least ten years must elapse before any of the parties to the agreement could apply to the court under Act 180, s. 4 (1) for the official winding-up of the company. It was not the court which said that the petitioner should not come before it until after the expiration of ten years; the parties themselves had so agreed. Since the petitioners were content to enter into the contract upon that footing, they could not complain if the respondents held them to their bargain.
