What case defines what an offer is?,"
Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms. Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated. It is important to emphasise the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations.

 
It is this need for finality and definiteness which leads to the analytical need for the concept of invitation to treat. If a communication during negotiations is not the final expression of an alleged offeror’s willingness to be bound, it may be interpreted as an invitation to the other party to use it as a basis for formulating a proposal emanating from him or her that is definite enough to qualify as an offer. Thus the indefinite communication may be what generates an offer from the other side. An invitation to treat is thus to be distinguished from an offer on the basis of the proposal’s lack of an essential characteristic of an offer, namely, its finality which gives a capacity to the offeree to transform the offer into a contract by the mere communication of his or her assent to its terms. Thus Chitty on Contracts (28th Edition, 1999) Vol. 1 para. 2-007 at p. 93 states that:

 
“A communication by which a party is invited to make an offer is commonly called an invitation to treat. It is distinguishable from an offer primarily on the ground that it is not made with the intention that it is to become binding as soon as the person to whom it is addressed simply communicates his assent to its terms.”

 
A case relied on by the appellant, Gibson v Manchester City Council \[1979\] 1 All ER 972, is illustrative of a communication during “negotiations” which was not definite and final enough to be treated as an offer and therefore was rightly categorized as an invitation to treat. The case involved the tenant of a council house in Manchester, England, who wanted to buy the house from the council. In the middle of the process for the purchase of the property, following local government elections in May 1971, the local council changed its policy and decided not to proceed with the sale of any house in respect of which there had not yet been an exchange of contracts. The correspondence between the tenant and the council before this reversal of policy was as follows:

 
After the city council had adopted a policy of selling houses to its tenants, the City Treasurer, following a request made by the tenant in this case for details of the price of the house he was renting and the mortgage terms available, had written on 10th February 1971 to the tenant stating that the council “may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price 2,725 pounds less 20% - 2,180 pounds (freehold).” The letter then set out the mortgage terms likely to be made available and continued:

While this case is of English origin, it has been widely adopted as a precedent in Ghana and other common law jurisdictions.\n\nIn this case, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company advertised a product that they claimed would prevent users from catching influenza. They offered a reward of £100 to anyone who contracted influenza after using their product as instructed. Mrs. Carlill purchased the product, used it as directed, and still caught influenza. She then sought to claim the reward.\n\nThe court held that the advertisement constituted an offer and since Mrs. Carlill had accepted the offer by purchasing and using the product, she was entitled to claim the reward. The court emphasized that an offer can be made to the world at large, and acceptance can be demonstrated through the performance of the requested act or by undertaking the necessary actions stipulated in the offer.\n\nThis case is significant as it established the principle that an offer can be made to the public at large, and acceptance can be proven by performing the required actions outlined in the offer. It clarified the notion of what constitutes an offer and established the binding nature of such offers when accepted.', 'The case of Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana v H. C. Kwansah (1970) 2 GLR 510 is often referenced in Ghanaian law to define what constitutes an offer. In this case, the court held that an offer is a definite proposal made by one party to another with the intention to create legal relations and be bound by the terms of the offer if accepted. It is important to note that each case is unique and may require an analysis of its own facts and circumstances to determine if an offer has been made. This answer provides a general reference to a notable case, but it is always advisable to consult a qualified legal professional for an in-depth analysis of your specific situation.', 'The case that defines what an offer is in Ghanaian law is the case of Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. This case established the principles for determining the existence of an offer in contract law. In this case, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company advertised a reward of £100 to any person who contracted influenza after using their product as directed. Mrs. Carlill purchased and used the product but still contracted influenza. When she claimed the reward, the company refused to pay. The court held that the advertisement constituted an offer that could be accepted by anyone who fulfilled the conditions stated in the advertisement. The case clarified that an offer can be made to the public as a whole and that acceptance of the offer can be through performance. Therefore, the Carlill case is the defining authority in Ghanaian law for understanding what constitutes an offer in contracts.']"

For an offer to be considered valid, it must meet certain requirements.\n\nFirstly, the offer must be communicated to the offeree. This means that the offeror must express their willingness to enter into a contract and make the terms of the offer known to the offeree. The communication can be made verbally, in writing, or even through conduct, as long as it is clear and unequivocal.\n\nSecondly, the offer must be definite and certain. The terms of the offer should be specific and leave no room for ambiguity or misunderstanding. The essential details such as the subject matter, price, quantity, and any conditions must be included in the offer.\n\nFurthermore, the offer must indicate an intention to create a legal relationship. Not all offers are intended to be legally binding. Some may be made in a social or domestic context where legal consequences are not intended. In order for an offer to be valid, it must be clear that the offeror intends to be legally bound by the terms of the offer.\n\nIt is important to note that a valid offer can be revoked by the offeror before it is accepted by the offeree. Once the offer is accepted, however, a binding contract is formed, and the offer cannot be revoked.\n\nIn summary, a valid offer under Ghanaian law is a definite and communicated proposal made with the intention of creating a legally binding agreement. It must be clear, certain, and indicate an intention to be legally bound.', 'A valid offer in Ghanaian law refers to a proposal made by one party to another, indicating their willingness to enter into a legally binding agreement. For an offer to be valid, it must meet certain criteria:\n\n1. Intention: The offeror must demonstrate a serious intention to enter into a contract. It should not be a mere statement of consideration or invitation to negotiate.\n\n2. Definite and Certain Terms: The offer must be clear and specific in its terms, including the subject matter, price, quantity, and any other essential terms. Vague or ambiguous offers may not be considered valid.\n\n3. Communication: The offer must be communicated to the offeree or their authorized representative. It can be done orally, in writing, or through other reasonable means of communication.\n\n4. From a Capable Person: The offer must be made by a person who has the capacity to enter into a contract, such as being of sound mind and legal age.\n\n5. Revocability: Generally, an offer can be revoked by the offeror at any time before it is accepted, unless there is an option agreement or an agreement to keep the offer open for a specific period.\n\nIt is important to note that an invitation to treat is different from an offer. An invitation to treat is an invitation for someone to make an offer, such as displaying goods for sale or inviting bids at an auction. Only when an offer is made in response to the invitation to treat does a valid offer come into existence.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is a general overview of what constitutes a valid offer in Ghanaian law. Specific circumstances may require further analysis and application of relevant statutes and case law. It is advisable to consult with a qualified legal professional for personalized advice.', ""In Ghanaian law, a valid offer is a proposal communicated by one party to another with the intention to enter into a legally binding contract. To be considered valid, an offer must meet certain requirements:\n\n1. Intention to create legal relations: The offer must demonstrate a serious intention to create a legal relationship. Social invitations or mere expressions of opinion are generally not considered valid offers.\n\n2. Definiteness: The offer must contain clear and definite terms. It should specify the essential elements of the contract, such as the subject matter, price, and terms of payment. Vague or incomplete offers may not be considered valid.\n\n3. Communication: The offer must be communicated to the offeree or their authorized representative. It is important for the offeree to be aware of the offer's existence to accept or reject it.\n\n4. Invitation to treat: Certain communications, such as advertisements or price lists, are generally considered invitations to treat rather than offers. An invitation to treat is an invitation for the offeree to make an offer, which can then be accepted or rejected.\n\n5. Revocation: An offer can be revoked by the offeror at any time before it is accepted. However, once the offeree has accepted the offer, it becomes binding, and the offeror can no longer revoke it.\n\nIt is important to note that the validity of an offer can be influenced by various factors, including the intentions of the parties involved, the context of the communication, and any specific contractual rules or regulations that may apply to the particular situation. This answer provides a general overview of what constitutes a valid offer in Ghanaian law, but specific circumstances may require further analysis to determine the validity of an offer.""]"
What are the principles of an injunction,"
\[Also see Vanderpuye vrs. Nartey \[1971\]1GLR 428, CA; Lardan vrs. Attorney General (1957) 3 WALR 55; Punjabi Bros vrs.

From the litany of judicial decisions, it has also long been settled that in considering an application for injunction, a court ought to consider inter alia the following factors:

 
These principles were reiterated by this Court in the case of 18th July vs. Yehans International Ltd (2012) SCGLR 167, as follows:

 
“Even though \[the grant of injunction\] is discretionary, we are of the view that a … court in determining interlocutory application must first consider whether the case of an applicant was not frivolous and had demonstrated that he had legal or equitable right which a court should protect. Second the court is also enjoined to ensure that the status quo is maintained so as to avoid any irreparable damage to the applicant pending the hearing of the matter. The trial court ought to consider the balance of convenience and should refuse the application if its grant would cause serious hardships to the other party…”

 
Further, injunctions being primarily discretionary, the bonafides and malafides of the parties cannot be ignored in ascertaining whether to grant or refuse. \[See Owusu vrs Owusu-Ansah (Supra)\]

Legal Right: In order for an injunction to be granted, the applicant must demonstrate that they have a legal right that needs to be protected or enforced. This means that they must establish that they have a right that is recognized and protected by law.\n\n2. Irreparable Harm: The applicant must also show that they will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted. This means that the harm or damage that they will suffer cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages. It must be a harm that is serious and cannot be undone or adequately compensated for at a later stage.\n\n3. Balance of Convenience: The court will consider the balance of convenience between the parties. This means that the court will weigh the harms or inconveniences that will be suffered by the applicant if the injunction is not granted against the harms or inconveniences that will be suffered by the respondent if the injunction is granted.\n\n4. Good Faith: The applicant must come to court with clean hands, meaning that they must have acted in good faith in seeking the injunction. If the court finds that the applicant has not acted in good faith or has misled the court, the injunction may not be granted.\n\n5. Public Interest: The court will also consider the public interest in granting or refusing the injunction. If the injunction goes against the public interest or would disrupt important public services or functions, the court may refuse to grant it.\n\nThese principles serve as the basis for the granting or refusal of injunctions in Ghanaian law. It is important to note that each case is unique and the court will consider the specific facts and circumstances of each case before making a decision.', 'The principles of an injunction are a fundamental aspect of the law that governs when and how injunctive relief may be granted. In Ghana, as in many jurisdictions, the courts may grant an injunction to prevent or prohibit certain actions or enforce specific conduct. The principles guiding the granting of an injunction include:\n\n1. Prima facie case: The party seeking an injunction must establish a strong, clear, and prima facie case with a reasonable chance of success. This means that the applicant must demonstrate that they have a valid claim that is likely to succeed if the matter proceeds to trial.\n\n2. Irreparable harm: The applicant must also demonstrate that they would suffer irreparable harm or injury if the injunction is not granted. This means that the harm should be significant and not easily remedied by monetary compensation alone.\n\n3. Balance of convenience: The court must consider the balance of convenience or the relative hardship to each party if the injunction is granted or denied. The court will weigh the potential harm or inconvenience to the applicant if the injunction is not granted against the potential harm or inconvenience to the respondent if it is granted.\n\n4. Public interest: The court will also consider the public interest and the impact that the granting or denial of an injunction may have on the public. The court will seek to ensure that its decision serves the overall public interest and does not result in any undue prejudice.\n\nIt is important to note that the granting of an injunction is a discretionary power of the court and is generally only granted in exceptional circumstances. The court weighs all relevant factors and exercises its discretion based on the specific circumstances of each case. These principles serve as a guide to help ensure that an injunction is granted or denied in a fair and equitable manner.', ""The principles of an injunction in Ghanaian law are as follows:\n\n1. Irreparable Harm: An injunction may be granted if the applicant can demonstrate that they will suffer irreparable harm or loss if the injunction is not granted. This means that the harm or loss cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages.\n\n2. Balance of Convenience: The court will consider the balance of convenience to determine if it is more just to grant or refuse the injunction. This involves weighing the harm that granting the injunction may cause to the other party versus the harm that the applicant will suffer if the injunction is not granted.\n\n3. Strong Prima Facie Case: The applicant must establish a strong prima facie case, which means that they must show that there is a high likelihood of success on the merits of their underlying claim.\n\n4. Necessity: It must be necessary for the court to grant the injunction to prevent future harm or maintain the status quo until the underlying legal dispute is resolved.\n\n5. Public Interest: The court will also consider the public interest in determining whether to grant an injunction. This involves weighing the potential harm to the public if the injunction is granted or refused.\n\nThese principles guide the court's decision-making process when considering whether to grant or refuse an injunction in Ghanaian law. It is important to note that each case is unique and the court will consider the specific facts and circumstances before making a decision.""]"
What underpins res ipsa loquitor principle,"
It seems to me with respect though that the appearance of the mere phrase ""res ipsa loquitur"" is by itself, in fact, no foundation at all for the invocation of the doctrine. In my view the true foundation for the invocation of the doctrine is as clearly stated in the above passage. It is merely pleading and nothing else, only ""the facts from which it is intended that the presumption should be drawn."" Unfortunately probably the cautious \[p.329\] way in which it was expressed has inadvertently, I believe, led an academic writer to misconceive the true ratio decidendi and to suggest in the usual vein of academic writers but very wrongly in my view, that the decision of the full bench in applying the principle to the case is hard to justify. In a comment in (1970) 2 R.G.L. 73 at pp. 74-75 the writer noted:

 
""the case before the full bench of the Court of Appeal reduced itself simply to this: Did the plaintiff's pleadings give \`fair notice' to the defendants that res ipsa loquitur would be invoked?""

 
This is obviously a wrong appraisal of the case which the court had to contend with. I would have thought the case rather reduced itself to this: Did the plaintiff by his pleadings give fair notice to the defendants of the facts on which his negligence actual or presumptive is based? Res ipsa loquitur after all means as Lord Shaw put it in Ballard v. North British Railway Co. 1923,, S.C. (H.L.) 43 at p. 56, that the thing that had happened, the subject-matter of the plaintiff's complaint ""tells its own story."" In other words it thus means merely that the thing speaks for itself. What is it that speaks for itself? It is the facts and circumstances of the case taken together that figuratively speak of negligence. Consequently to introduce res ipsa loquitur in pleadings in the manner done by Bullen and Leake and Benas and Essenhigh and as was done in this case means no more than that at the trial the plaintiff intends to argue that the facts he will produce are prima facie evidence of negligence. In other words contrary to the provision of Order 19, r. 4 he is pleading argument not facts. Now in Woodroffe and Ameer Ali's Civil Procedure in British India (2nd ed.), the editors commenting on the corresponding provision in the India Civil Code noted at p. 701 that, ""Modern pleadings are merely concise statements of the facts. Inference of law should not be pleaded. Pleadings should not contain mere arguments."" (The emphasis is mine.)

 
In the light of all this it is obvious that the following advice proffered by the writer in (1970) 2 R.G.L. 73 at p. 75 can hardly be said to be useful:

 
""Where counsel is in the slightest doubt as to whether his pleadings disclose the invocation of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, he will be wise to plead it specifically. If by any reason of omission or default he is not able to do so at the very beginning of the case, he would be well advised to take advantage of the earliest opportunity to amend his pleadings so as to indicate clearly that res ipsa loquitur is in issue.""

Now in Woodroffe and Ameer Ali's Civil Procedure in British India (2nd ed.), the editors commenting on the corresponding provision in the India Civil Code noted at p. 701 that, ""Modern pleadings are merely concise statements of the facts. Inference of law should not be pleaded. Pleadings should not contain mere arguments."" (The emphasis is mine.)

 
In the light of all this it is obvious that the following advice proffered by the writer in (1970) 2 R.G.L. 73 at p. 75 can hardly be said to be useful:

 
""Where counsel is in the slightest doubt as to whether his pleadings disclose the invocation of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, he will be wise to plead it specifically. If by any reason of omission or default he is not able to do so at the very beginning of the case, he would be well advised to take advantage of the earliest opportunity to amend his pleadings so as to indicate clearly that res ipsa loquitur is in issue.""

Under this principle, the occurrence itself implies negligence.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur requires three elements to be satisfied:\n\n1. The event must be of a kind that does not usually occur without negligence. This means that the accident or incident must be one that typically wouldn\'t happen unless someone was negligent.\n\n2. The instrumentality or thing causing the harm must be under the exclusive control of the defendant. The defendant must have had control over the situation or object that caused the harm.\n\n3. The injured party must not have been responsible for the accident. The person who suffered harm must not have contributed to the incident through their own negligence or actions.\n\nBy meeting these criteria, the principle of res ipsa loquitur allows the injured party to establish a presumption of negligence on the part of the defendant. However, it\'s important to note that this principle is not applicable in all cases and may have varying application depending on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction.', 'The principle of res ipsa loquitur, which translates to ""the thing speaks for itself"" in Latin, is a legal doctrine that allows for a presumption of negligence when an accident or injury occurs and the circumstances surrounding it suggest that the event would not have happened without someone\'s negligence. It is based on the idea that certain accidents or injuries do not ordinarily occur unless someone has been negligent, and it may be difficult for the injured party to provide direct evidence of the defendant\'s negligence.\n\nUnder this principle, the injured party does not need to prove the specific act of negligence, but instead relies on the inference of negligence from the circumstances surrounding the accident. The doctrine requires three elements to be satisfied:\n\n1. The event that caused the injury is of a kind that would not have normally occurred without negligence.\n2. The instrumentality or object that caused the injury was under the control of the defendant.\n3. The injured party did not contribute to the negligence.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur allows for the shifting of the burden of proof to the defendant, who must then present evidence to show that they were not negligent or that the accident was caused by factors beyond their control.\n\nIt is important to note that while res ipsa loquitur can be a helpful legal principle in certain cases, it is not applicable in all situations and its application depends on the specific facts and circumstances of each case.', 'Under Ghanaian law, the principle of res ipsa loquitur is rooted in the concept that certain accidents or events can speak for themselves. It is a Latin term that translates to ""the thing speaks for itself."" This principle applies in cases where the plaintiff cannot directly prove how an injury or harm occurred but can rely on the occurrence of the event itself to establish a presumption of negligence.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur allows a court to infer negligence based on the circumstances surrounding an incident. The three requirements that must be met for the principle to apply are:\n\n1. The event or accident must be of a kind that does not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence. In other words, it must be an event that does not happen without the negligent act of someone.\n\n2. The event or accident must be caused by an instrumentality or within the exclusive control of the defendant. This means that the defendant had control over the object or situation that caused the harm.\n\n3. The plaintiff must not have contributed to the event or accident through any negligence on their part. If the plaintiff\'s own negligence is a factor in the incident, then the principle of res ipsa loquitur may not apply.\n\nWhen these requirements are met, the courts may presume that the defendant was negligent, and the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to provide an explanation or defense to refute this presumption.\n\nIt is important to note that the application of res ipsa loquitur is subject to the specific facts and circumstances of each case. The court will evaluate the evidence presented and determine whether the principle is applicable.']"

One such circumstance is when the parent company exercises significant control or dominance over the subsidiary's operations and activities. This is known as piercing the corporate veil or disregarding the separate legal personality of the subsidiary.\n\nIn Ghana, the courts may disregard the separate legal personality of a subsidiary and hold the parent company liable if it can be shown that the subsidiary is acting as a mere agent or instrumentality of the parent company, or if the parent company is using the subsidiary to perpetrate fraud or injustice. This is typically done to prevent the parent company from evading its legal obligations by hiding behind the separate legal identity of the subsidiary.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this is a complex area of law and each case is evaluated on its own merits.

This is known as ""piercing the corporate veil"" and is done in exceptional circumstances. \n\nGenerally, a subsidiary company is a separate legal entity from its parent company, which means that it has its own liabilities and obligations. However, there are situations where the courts may hold the parent company liable for the acts or debts of its subsidiary. \n\nTo pierce the corporate veil, the courts will look at factors such as whether the subsidiary is merely an instrumentality or alter ego of the parent company, whether the subsidiary is being used to perpetrate fraud, or whether there is a clear disregard for the separate legal identity of the subsidiary. \n\nThe burden of proof lies with the party seeking to hold the parent company liable, and it can be a complex and difficult process.

This typically occurs when the subsidiary company is controlled and operated by the parent company to such an extent that they are effectively one entity.\n\nThe court will consider various factors to determine if the corporate veil should be pierced, including:\n\n1. Unity of ownership and control: If the parent company exercises complete control over the subsidiary, with no distinguishable separation between the two entities, the court may hold the parent company liable for the subsidiary\'s actions.\n\n2. Fraud or improper conduct: If the subsidiary was established or used by the parent company to perpetrate fraud or evade legal obligations, the court may disregard the separate legal identity of the subsidiary and hold the parent company liable.\n\n3. Inadequate capitalization: If the subsidiary is intentionally undercapitalized and unable to meet its obligations, the court may hold the parent company responsible for these liabilities.\n\n4. Unjust enrichment: If the subsidiary company\'s actions result in unjust enrichment for the parent company, the court may pierce the corporate veil to hold the parent company accountable.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that piercing the corporate veil is an exceptional remedy and the court will only do so in limited circumstances. Each case will be evaluated based on its own facts and circumstances.\n\nIt is recommended that any party seeking to extend liability to a parent company based on the actions of a subsidiary company consult with an experienced Ghanaian attorney to assess the specific details of the case and determine the likelihood of success.']"
can you repeat an injunction application in the same court,"
As was stated regarding applications for injunctions which are repeated in the same court in Vanderpuye v Nartey 1977 GLR 428 ‘The courts must be left to determine at their discretion when a party is using their processes to pursue his frivolous or vexatious ends’. The critical requirement of a court in an application for injunction is to determine whether it is just and convenient to grant same.

 
Section 12 (b) of the Courts Act allows the full court to look again at an order earlier made by a single judge. Rule 28 of CI 19 allows a party to repeat an application which was earlier presented to the court below for consideration of the full court of appeal.

 
I am quite satisfied that the combined effects of Section 12 (b) of the Courts Act, rule 28 and 31 (e) of CI 19 give this court sufficient authority to admit the application as being in accordance with due process and consider it on its merit, given the fact that the original injunction order was made by a single judge of the court and lapsed after 10 days. I am also satisfied that the repetition of this application will not constitute an abuse of process because inter alia, this application addresses the reasons why the conditions attached to the first order could not be obeyed.

 
I will now consider the application on its merits. The critical issue for this court to consider is whether on the strength of the pleadings, affidavits, exhibits and submissions brought to this court, it is just and convenient to grant this application without the conditions that the single Judge earlier attached to the order, because it is these conditions that caused the first order to lapse.

 
The fact that the Applicant has thrown in ‘new material’ that its counsel says has been discovered since April 2016 does not detract from the fact that but for the conditions which the Applicant says were impracticable to fulfill, the earlier order would not have lapsed and this application could not be before us.

battery and assault principles,"
In the case of Cole vrs. Turner {1706} 6 Mod. 149, Holt C.J. stated that the least “touching of another in anger is a battery;” and this is still the law. In the law of battery there is no requirement to prove that the contact caused or threatened to cause any physical injury or harm. Thus in the case of Wilson vrs. Pringle \[1986\] 2 AER 440 at page 495 C.A., it was held that “an intention to injure is not essential to an action for trespass to the person which is the offence.”

 
Therefore the culpable touching may take several forms subject to the Rule that the contact must be direct.

 
The principle in awarding damages is to compensate the “Plaintiff” for the losses pecuniary and non-pecuniary which he had sustained as a result of the “Defendant’s” tort – more specifically the assessment process is said to aim at restitutio in integrum.

 
Here we cite the oft-quoted words of Lord Blackburn that “the Court should award that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured or who has suffered in the same position as he would have been in if he had not suffered the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.”

In the case of Cole vrs. Turner {1706} 6 Mod. 149, Holt C.J. stated that the least “touching of another in anger is a battery;” and this is still the law. In the law of battery there is no requirement to prove that the contact caused or threatened to cause any physical injury or harm. Thus in the case of Wilson vrs. Pringle \[1986\] 2 AER 440 at page 495 C.A., it was held that “an intention to injure is not essential to an action for trespass to the person which is the offence.”

 
Therefore the culpable touching may take several forms subject to the Rule that the contact must be direct.

 
The principle in awarding damages is to compensate the “Plaintiff” for the losses pecuniary and non-pecuniary which he had sustained as a result of the “Defendant’s” tort – more specifically the assessment process is said to aim at restitutio in integrum.

 
Here we cite the oft-quoted words of Lord Blackburn that “the Court should award that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured or who has suffered in the same position as he would have been in if he had not suffered the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.”

It involves the actual application of force or unwanted touching, which may cause injury or harm to the victim. For example, if someone punches or slaps another person without their consent, it could constitute battery.\n\nAssault, on the other hand, refers to the intentional act of causing someone to reasonably fear immediate bodily harm or offensive contact. Unlike battery, assault does not require physical contact to occur. It focuses on the apprehension or fear of harm, rather than the actual physical harm itself. For instance, if someone raises their fist and threatens to hit another person, it could constitute assault.\n\nIt is important to note that battery and assault can be charged separately or together, depending on the circumstances. Both offenses are criminal acts in Ghana and can result in legal consequences such as fines, imprisonment, or both.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to consult with a qualified legal professional or refer to Ghanaian statutory laws and precedents for a more detailed and accurate understanding of battery and assault principles in the Ghanaian legal system.', ""Battery and assault are two separate but related legal principles in Ghanaian law. \n\nBattery refers to the intentional and unlawful touching or striking of another person without their consent. It involves physical contact and can range from a simple unwanted touch to more severe acts of violence. Battery is a criminal offense and can result in both criminal charges and civil liability.\n\nAssault, on the other hand, is the intentional act of creating a reasonable apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact with another person. Unlike battery, assault does not necessarily require physical contact. It can include threats, gestures, or any other actions that reasonably cause a person to fear for their safety or well-being. Assault can also be both a criminal offense and a civil wrong.\n\nIn order to establish liability for battery or assault, the following elements generally need to be proven:\n\n1. Intent: The defendant must have the intention to commit an act that results in the harmful or offensive contact (battery) or creates a reasonable fear of such contact (assault).\n\n2. Unlawful Act: The act committed must be deemed unlawful, meaning it violates the law or infringes on the rights of another person.\n\n3. Causation: There must be a direct causal link between the defendant's act and the resulting harm or fear.\n\nIt's important to note that self-defense can be a valid defense to allegations of battery or assault. If the defendant can establish that they acted in necessary self-defense to protect themselves or others from harm, they may be able to avoid liability.\n\nIt is advisable to consult with a qualified local attorney for specific advice and guidance regarding battery and assault under Ghanaian law, as the application of these principles can vary in different contexts and cases."", 'Battery and assault are both offenses under Ghanaian law. While they are often used interchangeably, they have distinct legal definitions and elements.\n\nBattery refers to the intentional and unlawful application of force to another person without their consent. It involves physical contact, such as striking or touching someone without their permission. The key elements of battery include intentionality and unlawfulness.\n\nAssault, on the other hand, is the intentional act of causing someone to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. Unlike battery, assault does not require physical contact. It can be committed by making threatening gestures, verbal threats, or even by raising a fist in a menacing manner. The key elements of assault include intentionality, the creation of fear or apprehension of violence, and unlawfulness.\n\nIn order for a person to be convicted of battery or assault, the prosecution must prove both elements beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that they must establish that the defendant intended to commit the act and that their actions were unlawful.\n\nIt is worth noting that self-defense can be a valid defense to both battery and assault charges in Ghana. If a person reasonably believes that they are in immediate danger of being harmed, they may use reasonable force to protect themselves. The force used must be proportionate to the perceived threat and must not exceed what is necessary to defend oneself.\n\nIt is crucial to consult with a qualified legal professional for detailed advice tailored to your specific circumstances. This response provides general information on the principles of battery and assault in Ghanaian law, but it is not a substitute for legal advice.']"
the effect of failure to correct an error apparent on the face of the record of appeal,"
The court proceeded further to mention three such blunders, as error on the face of a crucial documentary evidence, and finally, “the finding is so based on erroneous proposition of law, that if that proposition be corrected the finding disappears”. It is important to point out that the establishment of a blunder or error per se is not enough. It must further be established that the said error has led to a miscarriage of justice.

 
We do not think the appellant herein discharged the burden on him or passed the test in the case cited so as to warrant the findings of fact and the principles of law applied by the lower courts, to be interfered with or set aside in this appeal. We rather affirm all of them and dismiss all grounds of appeal, original and or additional.

 
For all the foregoing, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed and the appeal dismissed.

An error apparent on the face of the record of appeal refers to a mistake or error that is evident from a mere reading of the record of appeal without the need for any further evidence or investigation.\n\nIf a party fails to correct such an error, it may result in the error being perpetuated and potentially affecting the outcome of the appeal. The court may rely on the record of appeal as it stands, including any errors, and make a decision based on that. This means that an error in the record, even if apparent, can be treated as binding and may not be rectified.\n\nIt is crucial for parties to diligently review the record of appeal and notify the court of any errors. This can be done by filing an application to correct the error or seeking leave to amend the record of appeal. Failure to do so may limit the ability to challenge the decision based on the error in the future.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the rules and procedures governing appeals and the correction of errors may vary depending on the specific jurisdiction and the court involved. It is advisable to consult the relevant legislation, rules, and case law, as well as seek the guidance of legal professionals experienced in Ghanaian law, for specific and accurate advice tailored to the particular situation.', ""In Ghanaian law, the failure to correct an error apparent on the face of the record of appeal can have significant consequences.

This could include typographical errors, incorrect citations, or inaccurate statements of fact.\n\nThe Ghanaian legal system places a great emphasis on ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the record of appeal. As such, it is the responsibility of the parties involved to bring any errors on the face of the record to the attention of the court.

Force majeure refers to unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the parties that make it impossible or impracticable to fulfill their contractual obligations. \n\nTo successfully invoke force majeure, certain elements must be satisfied. First, there must be an unforeseeable event or circumstance that is outside the control of the affected party. This event or circumstance must make it impossible or significantly more difficult for the party to perform their obligations under the contract. Additionally, the affected party must not have caused the force majeure event through their own negligence or fault.\n\nIt is important to note that force majeure clauses are not implied in contracts and must be expressly included. The terms and conditions of the specific force majeure clause within a contract will determine its application. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully review the contract to determine the scope and application of the force majeure provision.\n\nIf a force majeure event occurs, the affected party may be excused from performing their contractual obligations for the duration of the event, or in some cases, the contract may be terminated altogether. However, it is crucial to analyze the specific language of the force majeure clause to determine the rights and obligations of the parties in such circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, force majeure is a recognized legal concept under Ghanaian law that can excuse a party from performing their contractual obligations in the event of unforeseeable and uncontrollable circumstances. It is a complex area of law, and legal advice should be sought to interpret the specific provisions of a contract and the applicability of force majeure in a given situation.', ""As a seasoned legal professional, I can provide a legal opinion on force majeure under Ghanaian law. \n\nUnder Ghanaian law, force majeure refers to unforeseen events or circumstances that are beyond the control of the parties involved in a contract and make it impossible for them to fulfill their contractual obligations. Force majeure events can include natural disasters, acts of terrorism, war, government actions, or any other event that is beyond the control of the parties.\n\nTo determine the applicability of force majeure in a specific contract, the language and provisions of the contract are of utmost importance. Contracts often include specific clauses that define force majeure events and outline the rights and obligations of the parties in such situations.\n\nIf a force majeure event occurs, the party seeking to rely on this provision must typically demonstrate that the event falls within the definition of force majeure in the contract, that it has hindered or prevented the performance of the contractual obligations, and that the party has taken reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of the event.\n\nIt's important to note that force majeure clauses are strictly construed, and it is not enough for a party to claim impossibility or difficulty in fulfilling its obligations. The party must show that the event was unforeseeable and that it was indeed the cause of the impossibility or delay.\n\nIn Ghana, force majeure clauses are generally upheld by the courts, but each case is examined on its specific facts and the language of the contract. It is important for parties to carefully review their contracts and seek legal advice to fully understand their rights and obligations in relation to force majeure events.\n\nIt is worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted many businesses to invoke force majeure clauses. However, the applicability of force majeure in relation to the pandemic will depend on the specific language of the contract, the impact of the pandemic on the party's ability to perform, and any relevant government regulations or orders.\n\nIn conclusion, force majeure is a legal concept recognized under Ghanaian law, and its applicability will depend on the specific contractual provisions and the circumstances surrounding the event in question. It is advisable for parties to seek legal advice and carefully review their contracts to determine the rights and obligations in a force majeure situation."", ""Force majeure refers to unforeseen circumstances or events beyond the control of the parties involved in a contract that prevent them from fulfilling their obligations. In Ghanaian law, force majeure is recognized and can be invoked to excuse a party's non-performance or delay in performance of contractual obligations.\n\nTo determine if a situation qualifies as force majeure, it is crucial to examine the specific terms of the contract in question. Typically, force majeure clauses in contracts will outline events or circumstances that are considered force majeure events. These may include acts of God, natural disasters, war, government actions, or other unforeseen events that are beyond the control of the parties.\n\nWhen a force majeure event occurs, the affected party must demonstrate that:\n\n1. The event was unforeseeable at the time of contract formation.\n2. The event is beyond the control of the party seeking relief.\n3. The event has made the performance of the contractual obligations impossible or significantly hindered.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the party invoking force majeure is usually relieved from their duty to perform under the contract or may be given an extension of time to perform, depending on the terms of the contract.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the force majeure clause must be explicitly included in the contract for it to be invoked. Parties seeking to rely on force majeure should carefully review the specific language and requirements of the clause to understand its scope and applicability.\n\nFurthermore, if there is a force majeure event, the affected party should promptly notify the other party of the event and its impact on their ability to perform. Failure to provide timely notice may result in a waiver of the right to rely on the force majeure clause.\n\nIt is important to consult with a qualified legal professional to assess the specific terms of the contract and circumstances surrounding the force majeure event to determine the legal implications and the rights and obligations of the parties involved. This response is a general overview and should not be considered as legal advice without a comprehensive review of the relevant contract and applicable laws.""]"

HEADNOTES

 
On 20 July 1971, the respondents, principal shareholders of Timber and Transport Co., Ltd. (T. & T. Co., Ltd.) entered into a written agreement with a Yugoslav company whereby the respondents agreed to transfer part of their shareholding in T & T Co., Ltd. to the Yugoslav firm, which for its part agreed to invest in and manage the company. It was further agreed that the name of T. & T. Co., Ltd. should be re-named: T. & T. Kumasi-Krusevac Co., Ltd. Clause 15 of the agreement provided that the agreement should remain irrevocable for ten years, and no member or director of the company as re-named could present \[p.371\] a petition or make an application to the court seeking the winding-up or the liquidation or in any way seek or attempt to bring the existence of the company to an end. Despite the existence of clause 15, the petitioners petitioned for the official winding-up of the company, and the appointment of the Registrar of Companies as the provisional liquidator. At the hearing of the petition, counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary objection as to whether having regard to clause 15 of the agreement, the petition was competent.

 
Held, upholding the preliminary objection: the law was clear that every contract was prima facie permanent and irrevocable, and it lay upon a person who said that it was revocable or determinable to show either some expression in the contract itself or something in the nature of the contract from which it was reasonable to be implied that it was not intended to be permanent and perpetual, but was to be in some way or other subject to determination. In the present case, the effect of clause 15 then was that a period of at least ten years must elapse before any of the parties to the agreement could apply to the court under Act 180, s. 4 (1) for the official winding-up of the company. It was not the court which said that the petitioner should not come before it until after the expiration of ten years; the parties themselves had so agreed. Since the petitioners were content to enter into the contract upon that footing, they could not complain if the respondents held them to their bargain.

Shareholders' Resolution: After the directors' resolution, a special resolution must be passed by the shareholders of the company at a general meeting. This resolution should be approved by at least 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders.\n\n3. Notice to the Registrar of Companies: Following the shareholders' resolution, a notice of the company's intention to dissolve must be sent to the Registrar of Companies in Ghana. This notice should be signed by a director or the company secretary and include details such as the company name, registration number, date of resolution, and effective date of dissolution.\n\n4. Notification to Creditors and Members: The company should also notify its creditors and members of the decision to dissolve. This can be done by sending individual notices or publishing a notice in the official gazette and a newspaper circulating in the locality where the company is registered.\n\n5. Settlement of Obligations: Before the dissolution, the company must settle all its obligations, including payment of debts, taxes, and employee salaries. Any remaining assets should be distributed among the shareholders in accordance with the company's articles of association or applicable laws.\n\n6. Clearance from the Registrar: Once all obligations have been settled, the company should apply to the Registrar of Companies for a clearance certificate. This certificate confirms that the company has fulfilled all legal requirements for dissolution.\n\n7. Publication of Dissolution: After obtaining the clearance certificate, a notice of the company's dissolution should be published in the official gazette and a newspaper circulating in the locality where the company is registered. This notice serves as a public announcement of the company's dissolution.\n\nPlease note that the specific procedures and requirements for company dissolution may vary depending on the type of company and its articles of association. It is advisable to seek professional legal advice to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."", ""To dissolve a company in Ghana, there are specific steps and requirements that must be followed. Generally, there are three methods of dissolving a company in Ghana:\n\n1. Voluntary Dissolution: A company can be voluntarily dissolved if its shareholders pass a special resolution, with at least 75% of the shareholders agreeing to the dissolution. This resolution should be submitted to the Registrar of Companies, along with the necessary documents such as the company's financial statements, a copy of the special resolution, and the company's certificate of incorporation. The Registrar will then issue a Certificate of Dissolution, officially terminating the company's existence.\n\n2. Dissolution by Court Order: A company can also be dissolved by a court order if it is unable to pay its debts or if it is just and equitable to dissolve the company due to internal disputes or breakdown of shareholder relationships. In such cases, an application must be filed in court, and if the court finds it appropriate, it can order the dissolution of the company.\n\n3. Automatic Dissolution: A company in Ghana can be automatically dissolved if it fails to file its annual returns for a continuous period of two years or more. In such cases, the Registrar of Companies may strike off the company from the register.\n\nIt is important to note that before initiating the dissolution process, the company should settle all its debts and liabilities, including taxes owed to the Ghana Revenue Authority. Additionally, it is advisable to consult with a legal professional or a corporate lawyer to ensure compliance with all legal requirements and avoid any potential complications during the dissolution process."", ""To dissolve a company in Ghana, there are certain steps and requirements that need to be followed:\n\n1.

In the case of a private company, this resolution must be passed by a special resolution, which requires the approval of at least 75% of the voting shares.\n\n3. Declaration of solvency: If the directors believe that the company is solvent, they should make a declaration of solvency stating that the company will be able to pay its debts in full within 12 months of the commencement of the winding-up. This declaration should be filed with the Registrar of Companies.\n\n4. Appointment of a liquidator: Once the resolutions have been passed and the declaration of solvency has been filed, a liquidator must be appointed to wind up the affairs of the company. The liquidator can be an individual or a professional firm.\n\n5. Notice: The dissolution of the company must be advertised in the Gazette and in at least one newspaper circulating in Ghana. The notice should state the name of the company, the date of dissolution, and the name and address of the liquidator.\n\n6. Distribution of assets: The liquidator is responsible for collecting and realizing the assets of the company. After paying off the debts and expenses of the liquidation, the remaining assets should be distributed among the shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings.\n\n7. Final accounts: The liquidator must prepare final accounts, showing how the assets of the company have been realized and distributed. These accounts should be filed with the Registrar of Companies.\n\n8. Cancellation of registration: Once the final accounts have been filed, the Registrar of Companies will cancel the registration of the company and issue a certificate of dissolution.\n\nIt is important to note that the process of dissolving a company may vary depending on the specific circumstances and type of company involved. It is advisable to seek legal advice to ensure compliance with all legal requirements.""]"
